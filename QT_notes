anchosrs  set the position, 
id must be unique,
root object - There can be only one

Qt use parent-child hierarchy to manage resource allocation , so when parent is destroyed all child got destroyed
load starting from root objet, then rest of object-tree ,when root destroyed ,all destroyed

opacity : 0.5  // value: 0--to--1  0.5=50% determine how transparent it is


xyz => Z is layering effect for overlapped images, who will be in top who in buttom

parent = desk , child reside on top of it: parent   making parent z=1 and child z=0 does not bring parent on top of child

child position 0,0 of its parent's postion, so child position relative to parent 0,0 postion 


Like QObject is the base class for everything
Item is base class for all qml elements type

taphandler on tapping
mouseArea used for more interactive than tap-handler, like it has feature drag and drop, many signals like onPostionChanged

mouseArea invisible item , mouseArea need a parent to visualization, like child of Rectangle
